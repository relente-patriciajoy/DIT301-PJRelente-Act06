1. Which API did you choose and why?
2. How did you implement data fetching and JSON parsing?
3. What challenges did you face when handling errors or slow connections?
4. How would you improve your app's UI or performance in future versions?


## Note on Platform
This Flutter Weather App was developed and tested on **Windows (Chrome browser)** due to technical limitations with Android emulator connectivity and device configuration.

The chrome browser testing demonstrates all required functionality:
  - Successful API integration with OpenWeatherMap
  - Real-time data fetching using HTTP package
  - JSON parsing and data modeling
  - Error handling (network errors, invalid cities)
  - Loading states and user feedback
  - Clean UI implementation

**Technical Implementation:**
The application successfully demonstrates networking concepts, API integration, and asynchronous programming in Flutter/Dart, which are the core learning objectives of this activity regardless of the deployment platform.

**Future Development:**
With proper Android development environment setup, this same codebase can be deployed to Android devices without any code modifications, as Flutter applications are inherently cross-platform.
